# Weather Application

The application takes in a five-digit zip code input and will display three day weather forecast.

## Getting Started

The project is built using Java so using any IDE that supports Java will work and can be used to create a .jar file to run in the desktop. For the application to work you will need a API from - https://openweathermap.org/
Once you have the API Key you can add to the .properties file.

### Prerequisites

The overall application is simple and works with any zip code in the continental united states.
